# This is a quiz game!

My kids have asked to make a game. A math game was requested, I also intend to create other games for their learning and enjoyment
I am currently thinking about doing quizzes and hope to be able to create a system that can automatically explain what was done incorrectly

## It contains / will contain

### A user system
  - Create user
  - Login
  - Scoreboard
  - Admin role
  - Possiblity to change passwords
  - Password hashing

### Several games
  - Math game
  - Geography game
  - History game
  - English Game


My first attempt at a login system. Transforming into a learning game that will be specialized for the things my kids want and need to learn
Using manual hashing just to see if I can do it
