My kids have asked to make a game. A math game was requested, I also intend to create English, Geography and History quizzes

##It contains / will contain

###- A user system

  - Create user
  - Login
  - Scoreboard
  - Admin role
  - Possiblity to change passwords
  - Password hashing

###- Several games

  - Math game
  - Geography game
  - History game
  - English Game


My first attempt at a login system. Transforming into a learning game that will be specialized for the things my kids want and need to learn
Using manual hashing just to see if I can do it
